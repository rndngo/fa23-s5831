# Project 3 Prep

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is an area that is small and has curves that connect to a room. A room is a big open space that can have a door in it. They are similar as they both use walls and floors.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer: We can connect the rooms through knightworld wtih the knights movement patters, and "L". For randomworld, we would just have to make rooms in random areas and then connect them through random paths.


**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer: Fill in the world with blanks to get a set size. Afterwards, we would want to get a starting point and branch out from there.


**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer: We could use methods that make a certain area, connect rooms, and a class function of a room, and hallway.
